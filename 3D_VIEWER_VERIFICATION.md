   - Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

3. **Resource Management**
   - Geometries disposed after use

- Measurement mode UI is placeholder (can be enhanced)
- No model export functionality
- No lighting adjustment controls

### Suggested Enhancements
1. **Add .mtl Support** - Load materials with .obj files

3. **Advanced Measurements** - Point-to-point distance tool
4. **Model Comparison** - Load multiple models
5. **Screenshot/Export** - Save rendered views
6. **Lighting Controls** - Adjust light intensity/position
7. **Material Editor** - Change model appearance
8. **Animation Support** - For .gltf files with animations
